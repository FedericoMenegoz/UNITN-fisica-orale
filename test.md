# Calculus Notes

## Derivatives

The derivative of $f(x) = x^n$ is:
$$f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$$

## Integration by Parts

$$\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du$$

Where $u$ and $dv$ are chosen strategically.

## Taylor Series

The Taylor series of $f(x)$ around $x = a$:

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$$
